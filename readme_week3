Part I 

* What is our overall conversion rate?

with sessions_converted as (
select 
  session_id
from
  dbt_pablo_d.stg_events
where
  event_type = 'checkout'
), 

unique_sessions as (
select 
  distinct(session_id)
from 
  dbt_pablo_d.stg_events
)

select 
  (select count(1) from sessions_conv)::float / (select count(1) from unique_sessions) as conv_rate
> 63%


* What is our conversion rate by product?

with product_views_and_purchases as (
select 
  product_id, 
  sum(product_viewed) nb_times_viewed,
  sum(purchased) nb_times_purchased
from
  dbt_pablo_d.dim_sessions
group by product_id
)

select 
  product_id,
  nb_times_purchased::float / nb_times_viewed as conversion
from 
  product_views_and_purchases
