1. What is our user repeat rate?

with nb_orders_per_user as (
  select 
    user_id, 
    count(*) as nb_delivered_orders
  from 
    dbt_pablo_d.stg_orders
  where
    status = 'delivered'
  group by 
    user_id)
select 
  sum(case when nb_delivered_orders >= 2 then 1 else 0 end)::float / count(*) as repeat_rate
from 
  nb_orders_per_user
> There is a 77% repeat rate

2. 
What are good indicators of a user who will likely purchase again?
- If a user is browsing more products or adding product to his cart after a previous purchase (events data)
- Maybe promos have an effect also in repeat purchases, we would need to dive into the impact of promos. 
- Maybe there are certain segments of clients or products which are more prone to generate repeat purchases. We would need to dive into the data to verify this. 

What about indicators of users who are likely NOT to purchase again?
- Maybe there are some users who only purchased because of a promo, but they wonÂ´t purchase again without that promo
- If a user has not been active (had a session) for a while posterior to his first purchase, maybe heÂ´s not interested any more

If you had more data, what features would you want to look into to answer this question?
- External data as social networks activity/interests: number of likes of things on a category similar to the product we sell
- Feedback from the client: customer satisfaction score
- Fraud information: was the first transaction payment fraud? 

3. Within each marts folder, create intermediate models and dimension/fact models.
Explain the marts models you added. Why did you organize the models in the way you did?
> Created the suggested dim and fact models, which make sense from a business perspective. Also created an intermediate int_orders_with_items model to be used when creating the fact_user_order table.
